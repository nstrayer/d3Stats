# A D3.js library to produce common statistical plots. 

Benefits of interactive stats plots: 
- For exploration things such as outliers can be more readily found by interaction rather than more code. 
- It makes sharing with non-statisticians easier (send them a webpage of their data). 
- Itâ€™s just kinda cool. 

The main goal of this is to hook it up with an R package for outputting the plots to RMarkdown and Shiny.
